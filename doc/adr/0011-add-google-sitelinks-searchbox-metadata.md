# 11. Add Google Sitelinks Searchbox metadata

Date: 2018-01-23

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Metadata can be added to a web site's home page to enable a search box directly within Google.

## Decision

Adding the required metadata is straight forward as the sites' search URL is the correct format for the Sitelinks Searchbox.
An additional term will be added to the query string to allow analytic metrics to distinguish Google searches from searches initiated from the main site.

## Consequences

Additional searches will come from Google rather than the Pharmacy Finder homepage.
